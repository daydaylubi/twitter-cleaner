## Migration Guides

### Migrating from Console Script to Extension

The Chrome extension version provides significant improvements over the original console script:

1. **No technical knowledge required** - graphical interface
2. **Better progress tracking** - real-time statistics
3. **Enhanced reliability** - improved error handling
4. **Safer operation** - no console access needed
5. **Better user experience** - intuitive controls

Migration steps:
1. Install the Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store
2. Configure your deletion preferences
3. Start cleaning with the click of a button

No data migration is required as the extension works directly with your Twitter account.
